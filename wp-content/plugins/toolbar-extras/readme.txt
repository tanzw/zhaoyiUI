Building sites with Elementor? Your work will get easier & faster with Toolbar Extras. With extended plugin & theme support baked right in.

== Description ==

Quick Access to Your Site Building Resources - Big Time Saver. Perfect for Non-Techies and Non-Coder Designers.
This smart WordPress plugin just adds some missed and **very useful admin links** to your Toolbar / Admin Bar. Save scrolling and time. Access settings and content pages faster from one central area in the Admin Dashboard AND when on the frontend of your site.

Out of the box the plugin includes support for dozens of awesome Plugins and Themes. Create Elementor templates right from the Toolbar, jump to Granular Controls settings or with one click you are on the Plugin Installer page to upload a new Elementor premium Add-On. Yes, it's so easy and fast. I released this plugin to the public to speed up your site building process even more - as the plugin already helps myself for a long time.

= Features - What the Plugin Does =
- Adds Page Builder links: Elementor & Elementor Pro - for example just add a new Elementor Template from the Toolbar, where Elementor builder loads right away and you begin building, yeah! :)
- Adds links for Elementor Add-On Plugins
- Adds links for Elementor-friendly Themes, that also Support Elementor Theme Builder (Pro Version 2.0+)
- Adds links for general, very useful Plugins (for Site Builders/ Designers/ Developers)
- Enhances "New Content" section (under "+ New") with more links - for content types, as well as Plugin & Theme installs
- Adds new groups & links to "Site" section (under your Website Title in Toolbar)
- Automatic detection of Local Development Environment - to better differentiate your development and live sites (works best with the App "Local by Flywheel" and a `.local` domain)
- Adds support for creating an "internal" new Menu for Admins which hooks into the Toolbar - using the regular WordPress nav menu system! (Menu location is: "Site Toolbar Menu")
- Adds useful external resource links to most of the above mentioned sections (could be disabled, of course!)
- A few smart tweaks to change some behavior of WordPress as well as some plugins - all regarding the Toolbar
- Some links/ tools aimed for developers (disabled by default, though)
- Adds plugin settings page (under "Settings > Toolbar Extras") so you have control over what is displayed and what's not!
- Any code is only loaded if needed - Example: if a supported plugin is not active, the links for it won't even be loaded code-wise!
- Non-Techie and Non-Coder Designer friendly :)
- Clean and efficient code
- Developer friendly - offering quite a few action hooks and filters for customization if needed
- Fully internationalized and translateable - also tested/optimized for RTL languages
- **[Video feature tour throughout the plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9Z5gW9vq0)**

= Support & Compatibility for more plugins =
Toolbar Extras supports even more plugins as listed here. Also, the plugin was tested with a lot of other plugins adding stuff to the Toolbar - and all works very well. We try to be not in the way of other plugins but rather work well together. This being said, Toolbar Extras even allows you to tweak the (Toolbar) behavior of a few selected plugins. This is really cool to save space in this bar and make the appearance overall a lot cleaner.

For full list of [supported plugins](https://toolbarextras.com/plugin-support/) and [third-party plugin compatibility](https://toolbarextras.com/docs/plugin-compatibility/) just **[visit our website at https://toolbarextras.com/features/](https://toolbarextras.com/features/)**

- Required: User is logged in (of course)
- Recommended: Plugin's settings are enabled to show the wanted links (or any filter/ constant in code)
- Recommended: Elementor Page Builder is installed & activated - Toolbar Extras plugin integrates fully with Elementor (Pro included) and is optimized for it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why another Toolbar plugin, there are already some others!?**
You're right! If you're happy with one of the others then that's absolutely great and you don't need to add or switch anything! :) I just made this new plugin here for my very own needs. Since I love to give back to the Community and as some kind of an open source evangelist I like to release my stuff to the public - for free!

Plugin developer David Decker: *What has proved its day to day usage and usefullness on more than 100 installs before, could be used by many other site builders as well, right? :-)))*

**Why is the Administrator Role required?**
This plugin only works and makes sense for Administrator users (and Super Admins in Multisite) just because the links it adds to the Toolbar normally do require those permissions for the original supported plugins and themes.

Example: The Elementor settings page requires the capability `manage_options` - by default, only Administrators have this capability. So Toolbar Extras "inherits" those capabilities (permissions) as well.

So, to see anything added to the Toolbar, it is required the user must have the cababilities of `manage_options` and `edit_theme_options`. As long as these are in place, Toolbar Extras is the perfect companion! :-)

(Note: Implementing other roles/ capabilities is not planned, and it makes no sense, really. It would require the codebase to be bloated with all those additional permission conditions and would give only very very few (if any at all!) additional links for roles like "Editor" or lower.)

**Is Elementor required for this plugin?**
Technically Elementor is not required. However, without Elementor being activated this plugin (Toolbar Extras) doesn't make much sense. Of course, the plugin supports deactivation of Elementor, though (for development, testing, whatever). When you do that (maybe for testing something) nothing strange will happen; I've included a fallback. Toolbar Extras acts smart :)

I totally [recommend Elementor](https://toolbarextras.com/go/elementor/) - so, with it active, this plugin here will make the perfect sense!

**Is Elementor Pro required for this plugin?**
Absolutely not. The supported links in Toolbar Extras will only be displayed once Elementor Pro is active.

However, I [strongly recommend Elementor Pro](https://toolbarextras.com/go/elementor-pro/) as it is so useful for Non-Coder Designers site builders.

**Is a Page Builder required at all for this Plugin to work?**
Absolutely not. The Toolbar Extras plugin has a lot of features for the Admin Bar that are fully independent from any Page Builder at all. So, of course, you can use it even if you have no Page Builder in use, or even none of the other supported plugins or themes activated. Toolbar Extras only loads features for third-party products if those are installed and activated and otherwise goes gracefully out of the way.

**Will other Page Builders be supported, beyond Elementor?**
In general: This is planned middle to long-term. Nothing is set in stone yet.

For "Beaver Builder" and "Thrive Architect" there are plans to release an Add-On for each one but no features or date is being set yet.

(Note: For a Page Builder to be considered for adding support it must be working without Shortcodes, as those Shortcode-based Builders will obviously have no bright future...!)

**Where can I find which exact Themes and Plugins are supported?**
You can find full listings on the plugin's website:

* [All supported Themes, Child Themes and Frameworks](https://toolbarextras.com/theme-support/)
* [All supported Elementor Add-On Plugins](https://toolbarextras.com/elementor-addons-support/)
* [All supported general Plugins](https://toolbarextras.com/plugin-support/)

**Will other Themes be supported?**
Yes, absolutely. – In general the Theme support in Toolbar Extras is considered as essential. And, I will only ever add Themes that work well with Page Builders (mostly Elementor) and are well established. If you have recommendations you can contact me.

For reference, you can find the complete list of supported themes here: [Currently supported Themes/ Child Themes and Theme Frameworks](https://toolbarextras.com/theme-support/)

**Will other third-party Plugins be supported?**
Yes, absolutely. - Though, we won't support every plugin under the sun, of course. For support to be included, the plugin has to meet at least one - better all - of the following conditions:

* is useful for site-builders and/or developers
* enhances the supported Page Builder
* has own settings/ admin pages or own post types/ page with data input
* additionally it should have a good reputation and be just useful (yes, say that again!)

**Will this Plugin slow down my site?**
Absolutely not. The plugin will only do its stuff for logged-in Administrator users. It does nothing for visitors of your site. Plugin loads its stuff only when needed and if supported theme/ plugin is active. Plugin was built to be as lightweight as possible.

**Does the Plugin work with Multisite?**
Yes, it works fine in Multisite, you could even activate it Network-wide. However, it does add almost nothing additional to the Network Admin but rather to the Dashboard of each individual sub-site of the Network. Therefore I recommend to use "Toolbar Extras" only in single installs (default) currently.

For Multisite installs I currently recommend my own plugin **["Multisite Toolbar Additions"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/)** which is like a "sister plugin" of Toolbar Extras (and even was there before it!).

*Update I:* Toolbar Extras version 1.3.2+ made Multisite support a first-class citizen, including Multisite-aware plugins. That means, if you want to use Toolbar Extras in your Multisite install, then please activate it Network-wide (recommended!); or at least on the Main Site of the Network.

*Update II:* A special Multisite Add-On for Toolbar Extras is planned but no date is being set yet. This Add-On will bring many improvements to the Network Admin area as well as specific plugin support for Multisite.

**More info on Translations?**

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/toolbar-extras/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `toolbar-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Toolbar Extras"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/toolbar-extras)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
